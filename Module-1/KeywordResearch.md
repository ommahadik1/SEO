# Keyword Research

Keyword research is the process of finding and analyzing the terms that people use to search for information in search engines. It is the foundation of any successful SEO strategy.

### The Process of Keyword Research

#### 1. Generate Keyword Ideas
Start by brainstorming broad "seed keywords" related to your topic. You can then use keyword research tools to expand these seeds into a large list of related terms and phrases.

#### 2. Validate Keyword Ideas
Not all keywords are worth targeting. You must validate your ideas by assessing them against several key metrics:

- **Search Demand:** The volume of monthly searches for a keyword.
- **Traffic Potential:** The total potential traffic a page could get by ranking for a keyword and its related terms. This is often more valuable than just search volume.
- **Business Potential:** How valuable the keyword is to your business goals. For example, "buy golf clubs" has higher business potential for an e-commerce store than "what is a birdie in golf."
- **Search Intent:** The reason behind the search. You must create content that aligns with what the searcher expects to find (e.g., a blog post, a product page, a video).
- **Ranking Difficulty:** An assessment of how difficult it will be to rank on the first page, often determined by the authority and backlink profiles of the current top-ranking pages.
