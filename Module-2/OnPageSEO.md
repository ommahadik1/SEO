# On-Page SEO

On-page SEO is the practice of optimizing individual web pages to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic from search engines. This includes optimizing both the content and the HTML source code.

### Key Elements of On-Page SEO

1.  **Satisfy Search Intent:** This is the most crucial part. Your page must provide the information that the user is looking for. Analyze the top-ranking results to understand the expected content type, format, and angle.

2.  **HTML Tag Optimization:**
    - **Title Tag:** Include your primary keyword where it makes sense. The title is a strong signal to search engines.
    - **URL:** Use short, descriptive URLs that include your keyword.
    - **Meta Description:** Write a compelling summary of your page to encourage clicks from the search results page.

3.  **Internal Linking:** Add links from your page to other relevant pages on your own website. This helps distribute page authority and helps search engines understand your site's structure.

4.  **Image Optimization:**
    - **Descriptive Filenames:** Name your image files descriptively (e.g., `on-page-seo-checklist.jpg`).
    - **Alt Text:** Provide alternative text for images to improve accessibility and give context to search engines.
    - **Compression:** Compress images to reduce their file size and improve page load speed.

5.  **Readability:** Make your content easy to consume by using short sentences, simple words, descriptive subheadings, and plenty of white space.
