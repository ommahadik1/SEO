# Link Building

Link building is the process of acquiring hyperlinks (or "backlinks") from other websites to your own. Backlinks are a primary ranking factor for Google because they act as votes of confidence from one site to another.

### Why Links are Important

- **Ranking Signal:** Google's original PageRank algorithm was built on backlinks, and they remain a critical signal of a page's authority and quality.
- **Discoverability:** Links help search engines discover new pages on your site.
- **Traffic:** A strong backlink profile correlates directly with higher organic search traffic.

### How to Get Backlinks

1.  **Create (Manual Links):** Manually adding links on directories, forums, or blog comments. These generally have low SEO value.
2.  **Buy (Paid Links):** Paying for links. This is against Google's guidelines and can result in penalties.
3.  **Earn (Editorial Links):** This is the most effective and recommended method. You earn links when other people link to your content because it is valuable. This is often achieved through:
    - **Email Outreach:** Reaching out to other website owners and asking them to link to your content.
    - **Becoming a Source:** Being cited by journalists and bloggers.

### What Makes a Good Backlink?

- **Relevance:** The link comes from a page and website that is topically related to yours.
- **Authority:** The link is from a strong, authoritative, and trustworthy website.
- **Placement:** Links placed within the main body content are typically more valuable than those in a footer or sidebar.
- **"Followed" Links:** A standard link passes authority (or "link juice"). Links with a `nofollow` attribute do not.
