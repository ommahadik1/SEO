# How Search Engines Work

Search engines essentially have two primary functions: crawling/indexation and ranking.

### 1. Crawling and Indexation
Search engines like Google use automated bots, also known as "crawlers" or "spiders," to discover publicly available web pages.

- The process starts with a list of known URLs.
- The crawlers follow hyperlinks from these pages to find new pages.
- All the discovered information is then stored and organized in a massive database called a **search index**. When you perform a search, you are searching this index, not the live web.

### 2. The Ranking Algorithm
When a user enters a query, the search engine sifts through its index to find the most relevant results. Google uses a complex algorithm with hundreds of ranking signals to determine this order. While the exact formula is a secret, key factors include:

- **Backlinks:** Links from other reputable websites act as "votes," signaling that your content is trustworthy.
- **Search Intent:** The algorithm tries to understand the *reason* behind a search query to deliver content that best matches the user's needs.
- **Content Depth & Quality:** The content must be comprehensive, accurate, and provide a thorough answer to the searcher's query.
