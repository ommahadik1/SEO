# What is SEO?

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of optimizing your content to be discovered through a search engine's organic (non-paid) search results.

It's about making your website and its pages more attractive to search engines like Google, which in turn can lead to higher rankings for relevant searches. The ultimate goal is to increase the visibility of your website and drive more organic traffic.
