# Technical SEO

Technical SEO refers to the process of optimizing your website's infrastructure to help search engines find, crawl, and index your pages more effectively. It ensures that your site has a solid foundation for all other SEO efforts.

### Key Areas of Technical SEO

1.  **Noindex Meta Tag:** Ensure that the `noindex` tag is not accidentally present on pages you want to rank. This tag tells search engines to exclude a page from their index.

2.  **Robots.txt:** This is a text file that instructs search engine crawlers on which pages or sections of your site they should not crawl. It's important to make sure you are not blocking important content.

3.  **Sitemaps:** An XML sitemap is a file that lists all the important URLs on your site. Submitting it to Google helps them discover and crawl your content more intelligently.

4.  **Redirects:** Use redirects (like a 301 redirect) to send users and search engines to a different URL from the one they originally requested. This is crucial for consolidating link equity when a URL changes.

5.  **Canonical Tag:** Use the canonical tag (`rel="canonical"`) to specify the "preferred" version of a page, which helps prevent issues with duplicate content.

6.  **Page Speed:** How fast your pages load is a confirmed ranking factor. Optimize page speed by compressing images and enabling browser caching.

7.  **Website Audits:** Regularly run a site audit using SEO tools to identify and fix technical issues like broken links, duplicate content, and redirect chains.
